## My Pokemon Journal

Collecting Pokemon(and the games they're in) is loads of fun, but sometimes you just need a break. This app allows you to keep track of what you were doing in your games so you can get right back to the fun when you return.


## README Requirements
Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md.

The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

Note: Do not include project planning (user stories, wireframes or ERDs) in the README.md.

Include the following sections within the README.md:

## ☐ App Title: Contains a description of what the app does and optional background info.

## ☐ Screenshot(s): A screenshot of your app's landing page and any other screenshots of interest.

## ☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used.

## ☐ Getting Started: That Includes:

* A link to the deployed app (Heroku)
* A link to the Trello board used for the project's planning that includes user stories, wireframes & an ERD.
## ☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).
